This Repository contains programming projects from HS Computer Science Classes.

11th Grade is intraductory Java projects. I don't remember much about them so I can't elaborate.

12th Grade is entirely projects made in Game Maker Studio 2. The class was supposed to use the Java teaching tool "Greenfoot",
but the teach let me do my projects in GMS2 because he was cool.

Most of the projects found here either do not function or are incomplete. I was not a very good student.
