Files that were never published are dated by their last modified date.
  I don't know any way to find the date a Scratch project was initially created.
Published files are dated by their publishing date.

I added every project I could still access from my Scratch account to this repository.
I don't think I ever permanently deleted any files, but some projects are lost either because their links are now broken, 
or becuase I had significantly modified them without cloning them first to a new project.
